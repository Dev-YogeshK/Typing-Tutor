She loves me,
But maybe love is such a hard thing for her to admit

She calls me first,
to give good or bad news,
She gets filled with joy,
At my presence and jumps to hug me without me asking

She loves me,
But maybe love is such a hard thing for her to admit

She gets jealous,
Whenever I'm conversing with other girls,
The look in her eyes shows me the hurt,
And the silence she'll give the next few hours

All because she loves me,
But maybe love is such a hard thing for her to admit

She talks of men in a disgusting way,
Then looks at me to confirm if I'm hurt,
And she goes on to say I'm different,
Before I even get to say a thing

I know she loves me,
But maybe love is such a hard thing for her to admit

She plays hard to get,
Calls me bro to make feel we can't date,
Yet get offended,
When I flirt with someone else

She loves me,
But maybe love is such a hard thing for her to admit

See she's gave her all before,
To someone who didn't even give half of it,
And I guess it scares her,
Another chance of love will turn out the same

Though she loves me,
She just finds love a hurting thing to get involved in,again!
