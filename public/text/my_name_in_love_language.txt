Too much games of the heart
That this world has become a part
The love for money has eventually won
True love has been disposed to the wind that's blown
Or probably drained deep into the sewers
Leaving behind a holiday for gold diggers
So when I find you
And in my world you make a debut
I hope the signals get stronger as our eyes meet
For you to make a feeling in my heart to generate
May the events conspire
For me to know it's you thereafter
I hope I'll have the courage to approach you
To be able to have a better view
Hopefully I would have learned how to handle love
And we'll fit like an elastic glove
When I find you
May you love me like I would do
