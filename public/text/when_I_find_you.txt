Call me in the name my love portrays
Call me babe if my love to you is of tender care
Call me sweetheart, Call me sugar
Let me know if my actions reflects the sweetness of my heart
Call me dear, Call me Love
Call me in public for all to know I'm yours
Call me king as I call you queen
Show me you're comfortable in our kingdom of nothingness but Love
Call me charming, Call me heaven sweet
Let it be clear to me I'm the one you used to dream about
Call me your superhuman
And watch me boast to my friends of being yours
Call me honey, Call ,me sweetie
Show me how much you are affectionate to me
Call me babyluv or coin your own word
Just call my name in love language
So I'll know how much you love me
